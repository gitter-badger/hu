# hu.js

## About

**hu** is a ridiculous tiny utility helper library designed to be embedded or bundled in applications 
without hurting your feelings. It provides a set of trivial utility functions that you probably are constantly looking for in each new application.

As you probably already know about underscore, lodash or sugar.js, 
hu only provides the most trivial functions for basic purposes, keeping it as a 
lightweight and tiny library that can be embedded as a part of your application or own library

## Installation

#### Node.js

```
$ npm install hu
```

#### Browser

Via Bower package manager
```
$ bower install hu
```
Or loading the script remotely (just for testing or development)
```html
<script src="//rawgithub.com/h2non/hu.js/master/hu.js"></script>
```

## API

### Example
```
var hu = require('hu')

hu.each(obj, function (val, ) {
  
})
```
